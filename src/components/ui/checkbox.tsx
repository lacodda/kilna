/*
 * Checkbox - a box, its tick, and the words next to it.
 *
 * The interesting part is the words. A checkbox on its own is a nine-pixel
 * target that says nothing; wired to a label it is the whole row, and the row
 * is what a finger and a pointer both aim at. So the label is part of the
 * component rather than something a caller remembers to add - the commonest
 * bug in a hand-rolled checkbox is a `<label>` that is next to the input
 * instead of tied to it, which looks identical and does nothing.
 *
 * The box is drawn rather than native. `appearance: none` on a real
 * `<input type=checkbox>` is the other way, and it takes the indeterminate
 * state with it: the dash is not a character the input can be told to draw.
 * Base UI renders a button with the right role and state, and the tick and
 * the dash are ours, in the accent, sized to the text next to them.
 *
 * `indeterminate` is a real state, not a third value: it says "some of the
 * things below are checked", and clicking still means check-all. A tri-state
 * value would make every caller handle a case that does not exist.
