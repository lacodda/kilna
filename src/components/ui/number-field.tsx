/*
 * NumberField - a number, and the two ways of changing it.
 *
 * A number typed into a text input is a string that happens to look like a
 * number, and every product then writes the same four fixes: strip the
 * letters, clamp to a range, round to a step, and decide what an empty box
 * means. This is those four, once, plus the stepper - because a value with a
 * small range is faster nudged than typed.
 *
 * Base UI carries the parts that are genuinely hard: the arrow keys with
 * PageUp/PageDown for the large step, the parse of what a person actually
 * types (spaces, a comma for a decimal point, a pasted currency string), and
 * `Intl.NumberFormat` for how it reads back. That last one matters more than
 * it looks: a number field that shows `1234.5` where the reader writes
 * `1 234,5` is a field they have to translate in their head.
 *
 * `unit` is ours, and it is a label rather than part of the value. Putting
 * "px" inside the input makes it something to parse and something to delete
 * by accident; beside the input it is a caption that cannot be typed into.
 * The value stays a number.
 *
 * Empty is `null`, not zero. "No number" and "the number zero" are different
 * facts - a price of nothing and no price yet - and a field that returns 0 for
 * an empty box makes them the same the moment it is saved.
