/*
 * ContextMenu.
 *
 * The same list of actions as Menu, opened the other way round: by right
 * click, or by a long press on a touch screen, over an *area* rather than
 * from a button. So the trigger is not a control - it is the region the menu
 * belongs to, a row, a canvas, a file tile - and it renders a `<div>`.
 *
 * That difference is the whole component. Everything below the Root is Menu's
 * own: Base UI re-exports the Portal, Positioner, Popup, Item and the rest
 * from the menu package, so the popup that opens here is literally the same
 * popup, with the same keyboard, the same type-ahead and the same submenus.
 *
 * Which is why the clothes are imported rather than copied. Two `cva` calls
 * that started identical drift within a release - one gets a padding fix, the
 * other does not - and then a product has two menus that are almost the same,
 * which is worse than two that differ on purpose.
 *
 * What Base UI does *not* give this one is `openOnHover`, `modal` or a
 * `handle`: a context menu is opened by a gesture over an anchor point, not
 * by a trigger element it can be attached to from elsewhere.
