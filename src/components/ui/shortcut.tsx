/*
 * Shortcut.
 *
 * The one notation the line writes keys in, and the one reading of a
 * keystroke against it, so that what is bound, what is shown and what a
 * person rebinds are the same words.
 *
 * A shortcut is a string, written the way it is read: `Mod+K`, `Mod+Shift+P`,
 * `?`, `Escape`. A sequence is its steps with a space between them - `G D` is
 * G, then D. A string because it has to live in more places than code: in a
 * settings file where someone has rebound it, in a menu hint, in the sheet that
 * lists every key, and in a comparison that says two commands share one.
 *
 * `Mod` is command on Apple platforms and control everywhere else. `Ctrl` is
 * the control key itself, which only means something different on a Mac -
 * `Ctrl+Tab` switches tabs there, where `Mod+Tab` belongs to the system.
 *
 * Two rules decide what a keystroke *is*, and both are about the people the
 * line is made for, who switch keyboard layouts in the middle of a sentence:
 *
 *   - A letter is the letter the key types when the layout types Latin, and
 *     the key's place when it does not. On a Russian layout `Ctrl+P` arrives
 *     as `з`; reading `event.key` there makes every shortcut in the
 *     application stop working the moment someone switches language to write.
 *   - Any other character is the character typed, with Shift inside it. `?`
 *     is Shift+/ on one keyboard and Shift+7 on another, and the person
 *     pressing it means the question mark on both. So `?` is written as `?`,
 *     never as `Shift+/` - and the notation refuses the second spelling,
 *     because two spellings of one key is how two commands end up on it
 *     without a conflict ever being seen.
 *
 * The number row under a command modifier is read by place as well: `Mod+1`
 * on a French keyboard is pressed on the key that types `&`.
