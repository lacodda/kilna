/*
 * Commands.
 *
 * One list of everything the application can do, declared where the doing
 * lives - and the keyboard, the command palette and the sheet of shortcuts all
 * read that list, so a key is written once and none of them can be a version
 * behind.
 *
 * Every product that grew a palette wrote a key three times: in the listener
 * that answers it, in the palette row that hints at it, and in the help sheet
 * that lists it. The three drift - the sheet promises a key the listener no
 * longer answers, the palette hints one that was rebound - and nothing says
 * so. Here a command is declared once, `{ id, label, keys, run }`, by the
 * component that owns what it does, for as long as that component is mounted.
 *
 * There is one list per window, not one per provider, because there is one
 * keyboard per window. Two lists would be two listeners on the same keys,
 * which is exactly the conflict this exists to catch - so the list is the
 * module itself, and a command can be declared from anywhere without a
 * provider above it.
 *
 * What the list decides:
 *
 *   - **Sequences.** `G D` is G, then D within a second and a half. A key that
 *     does not continue the sequence ends it and does nothing else: a `g`
 *     pressed by mistake should not turn the next keystroke into a jump.
 *   - **Where a key is answered.** Not in a field someone is typing in, unless
 *     the command says it belongs there. A plain key - one without Mod, Ctrl
 *     or Alt - is not answered inside a dialog, a menu, a listbox or a tree
 *     either, which own their letters, nor Enter and Space on whatever has the
 *     focus, which they press. A command declared `within` an element answers
 *     only while the focus is inside it, and it wins over the rest of the
 *     application there.
 *   - **Conflicts.** Two commands on the same keys in the same place, or one
 *     on a prefix of the other's sequence, cannot both work. The one declared
 *     first keeps the keys - mounted earlier, or earlier in the tree when
 *     mounted together, so a shell's own commands outrank a screen's - and the
 *     other loses them in the keyboard, in the palette's hint and in the sheet
 *     alike, and the console says which.
