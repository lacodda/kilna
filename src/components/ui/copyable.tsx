/*
 * Copyable.
 *
 * Any text that someone will eventually want to copy - an id, a path, a hash,
 * a token - copied with one click. The rule comes from nitid: if a value is
 * worth showing, it is worth being able to take away, and selecting a
 * monospaced id by hand is a small daily tax.
 *
 * Two things this gets right that the hand-written version usually does not.
 * It is a `<button>`, so the keyboard can reach it and a screen reader says
 * what it does. And the confirmation is announced, not only drawn: a tick that
 * appears silently tells a sighted user it worked and tells nobody else.
 *
 * The clipboard can refuse - it needs a secure context and, in some browsers,
 * a permission. A refusal is reported rather than swallowed, because a button
 * that looks like it worked and did not is worse than one that says it failed.
